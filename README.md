# ProDigy Infotech - Software Development Internship Tasks

Overview
This repository contains the solutions to the tasks assigned during my Software Development Internship at ProDigy Infotech. The tasks involve developing different C++ programs, each designed to solve a specific problem or provide a particular functionality.

Tasks
1. Task-01: Temperature Conversion Program
Description: This program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs a temperature and its original unit, and the program outputs the temperature in the other two units.
File: TemperatureConversion.cpp

2. Task-02: Guessing Game
Description: A simple guessing game where the program generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of attempts.
File: GuessingGame.cpp

3. Task-03: Simple Contact Management System
Description: This program allows users to store and manage contact information, including adding new contacts, viewing the contact list, editing existing contacts, and deleting contacts. The contact information is saved in a file for persistent storage.
File: ContactManagementSystem.cpp

4. Task-04: Sudoku Solver
Description: A program that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The user inputs an unsolved Sudoku grid, and the program fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle.
File: SudokuSolver.cpp
